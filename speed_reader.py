# Problem: Create a program that can displays a book word by word to the user. The book must be specified by the user,
#           and the user has the options to pick the font, as well as the amount of words per minute.
#
#
# ALGORITHM :
# 1.	Ask user for file name.
#   a.	Try/Except to prevent errors for incorrect names.
#   b.	Keep asking until file can be opened.
#   c.	Files are UTF-8. Verify encoding under utf-8.
# 2.	Ask user for Words per Minute. (Divide Words per Minute/60 to figure out pause between words)
#   a.	Try/Except to prevent errors from non-numbers
#   b.	Keep asking until valid number (1<= x >= 1000).
#   c.	If word ends in punctuation, double pause time.
# 3.	Ask user for font size.
#   a.	Try/Except to prevent errors from non-numbers
#   b.	Force font size between 5 and 36 inclusive.
# 4.	Ask user for word to start reading at.
#   a.	Try/Except to prevent errors from non numbers
#   b.	Number range from 1 â€“ last word of book inclusive
#   c.	Keep asking until valid number or user hits enter with no input.
#   d.	Enter with no input starts at 1.
# 5.	Split file into individual words.
# 6.	Create window.
# 7.	Output words to window.
# 8.	Display Current word out of total (Current/Total)
#   a.	Display should be at bottom of window.
#   b.	Font size should  not be large.
#   9.	Allow users to click to pause.
#   a.	Clicking again would unpause.
# 10.	Close window.
#   a.	User should be able to escape the window without causing an error.
# 11.	Close file
# 12.	Ask user if they want to run the program again
